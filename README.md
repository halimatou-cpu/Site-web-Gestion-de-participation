# Site-web-Gestion-de-participation

As front end framework, i used boostrap for this project!

To launch it via localhost, follow the steps described below:
- Import the database (the "2020_projet7_participations" file) on phpMyAdmin.
- Then open it in a browser

To log in, you have two choices.
There are two types of functionality. It depends on whether you are an administrator or not.

-As administrator: 
Login: admin
Password: admin

-As user:
Login: test
Password: test

Note that you can log in as an administration, add new user, then disconnect. => to have a new id

Thanks to give me your feedback after checking my project, or if you have suggestions to make it better, share them with me.🙂🤝
